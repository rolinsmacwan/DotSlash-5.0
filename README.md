# Theme : Breaking the Language Barrier 

-> My project is going to work in real-time translation. Through real-time translation, I will be able to break down language barriers.

-> For this project, I'll utilize Python. My model should be able to follow a specific path.

   1. My device becomes active when the user issues a certain command. They must specify which language they wish to convert into.
   2. As an input, my gadget receives real-time data in audio format.
   3. It will use libraries to convert to text format.
   4. They will then translate into the desired language, which the user has previously picked.
   5. The output of the translated script will be in audio format.

-> What's fresh on the horizon?

   1. I also want to integrate gesture language for handicapped individuals so that we can communicate with them more readily.
   2. My model should capture information in text format as well, so that any remarks may be translated into the user's local language.
